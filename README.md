## CONSIDERATIONS

This POC was interrupted due to the study of more urgent technologies for my daily work. I will return at some point to finish. But, still, I was able to have a great experience with what was developed. I want to thank my friend Chrystian (@chrystianariel) for the application design, it looks great!
